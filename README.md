<h2>Data Layer</h2>
<p>
	The report is connected to a live data source that Ms Muller provided to use. The data source requires our NWU MS Fed credentials to connect
	which implements security. The relationships of the data source needed to be reworked in Power BI which I have done and
	all the data types have been ensured to be correct
</p>
<h2>Business Logic Layer</h2>
<p>
	Key Measures and Calculated Column (split year): <br />
	<br /><img src="img/Business Logic Layer.png" alt=""/><br />
	No addition business logic has been implemented on the report. I added slicers on my Device Monitoring dashboard to filter even further
	to offer different perspectives
</p>
<h2>Presentation Layer</h2>
<p>
	All visuals and filters across the entire report have been added, please see the Dashboards section above for quick reference
</p>
<h2>Scrum Implementation</h2>
<p>
	The student has successfully kept his GitHub board updated throughout Project 5 as the board was set up in Project 1. Also, the student's Project 5 repository is 
	linked to his GitHub board and a lot of effort was done to link the exact repositories of each Project that was done and what must be done to each task (Repository 
	and Linked Assessment fields).

</p>
<h2>Source Control</h2>
<p>
	The student added Project 5 to his GitHub profile on day 1 and every change that has been decided to commit was committed. The branching strategy that was set up in 
	Project 1 was followed to the T which demonstrated an iterative use of GitHub throughout Project 5 to successfully manage version control of the project. The student 
	also did a lot of effort in providing a very well laid out README.md file by explaining everything possible to make it easier for the person trying to figure everything out.<br />
	<br />The student started developing Project 5 on Oct 27, 2022: <br />

	The student also ensured that no credentials are available or present in the repository.
</p>
<h2>Reference List</h2>
<p>
	The student provided a reference list with over 25 references on the Project 5 repository and the submission form. Only websites that were relevant and actually useful to 
	produce this successful project were referenced.
